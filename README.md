This project is a personal side project aimed at understanding the working of git and github as well as understanding concepts like NLP, ML, AI, DM among others.

The aim is to create an AI chatbot which will act as a counselor.

Currently the project is in it's initial stage. I am currently trying to gain a deeper understanding of concepts required for completing the project.
